	abstract = {Two experirnents were conducted to assess the effects of storage conditions on the quality of large round bales (LRB). Samples were taken at 75-d intervals from LRB stored inside, outside single bales covered with a l5-mm black polyethylene plastic bag, outside uncovered as single bales, outside uncovered in a single row and outside uncovered in a double stacked row. Bales were sampled at depths of 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm. Time, storage and depth factors had an influence on the chemical components of the LRB except for protein. Wearhering had the most effect after 150 d of storage and with LRB stored uncovered and in the top 15-cm layer. Significant (P{\textless}0.05) interactions in in vitro dry matter digestibilities were found for storage time x depth of sample, storage time x storage methods and for depth of sample x storage methods. Under the conditions of our experiments, weathering damages were limited to the superficial layer of LRB left uncovered.},

The portability and low long-term maintenance costs of this technology coupled with rapid turn around time on processing offers a mechanism for nutrition programs to address forage and dietary quality issues that were limited due to high maintenance costs of wet chemistry laboratories. The fundamentals of NIRS technology and associated development of calibration equations are discussed along with methods to validate equations. Direct methods for tissue analysis and indirect methods to predict diet quality from feces are reviewed for major constituents found in forages, including crude protein, digestibility, tannins and minerals.},

Thepredictive capacity of anydegreeday model is dependent on an accurate determination of the basal growthtemperaturesfor the species underconsideration. Theobjective of this study was to determine basal growthtemperaturesand growth rate constants for eight warmseason turfgrasses (five species). Sprigs from bermudagrass[Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. cv. Arizona Common and C. dactylon Ic C. transvaalensis Burtt Daveycv. Midiron], buffaiograss [Buchlo\# dactyloides (Nutt.) Engeim. cv. Kansas Common and Texoka], zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steudel cv.

Commonw] ere grown at temperatures ranging from 5 to 30°C in a controlled environment chamber under 14-h photoperiods. Chambertemperature was decreased in a step-wise fashion to the next temperatureafter twoleaves were fully expanded. Leaf growth rates at each temperaturewerecalculated and expressed as millimeters per day. Base temperature and growth rate constants for each turfgrass werecalculated with segmentednonlinear regression analysis. Base temperaturesfor the eight tested cnltivars rangedfrom 0 to 13°C. Interspecific and intraspecific differences for basal growth temperaturewerefound, indicating that degree-daymodelapplication accuracy is dependent on proper determination of target species and cultivar basal growth temperature.},

'Ihe original Bacillus subtilis enzyme Type IIIA (XIA) no longer is available and has been replaced by a less effective enzyme. For fiber work, a new enzyme' has received AOAC approval and is rapidly displacing other amylases in analytical work. This enzyme is available from Sigma (Number A3306, Sigma Chemical Co.,St. Louis, MO). The original publications for NDF and ADF (43, 53) and the Agricultural Handbook 379 (14)are obsolete and of historical interest only. Up to date procedures should be followed. Tnethylene glycol has replaced 2-ethoxyethanol because of reported toxicity. Considerable development in regard to fiber methods has occurred over the past 5 yr because of a redefinition of dietary fiber for man and monogastric animals that includes lignin and all polysaccharides resistant to mammalian digestive enzymes. In addition to NDF, new improved methods for total dietary fiber and nonstarch polysaccharides including pectin and B-glucans now are available. The latter are also of interest in rumen fermentation.

The need for an extensive database against which the instruments is calibrated and the importance of good wet chemistry backup to NIRS are emphasised, together with some of the diverse uses for NIRS in research and agriculture. Examples are given of contrasting analyses for quality of maize silage and pastures. NIRS prediction of pasture, silage and supplement composition can be used in conjunction with a ration balancing model developed for the New Zealand dairy industry, allowing farmers to formulate diets able to meet desired levels of production.},
